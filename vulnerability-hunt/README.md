# Welcome to Vulnerability Hunt ðŸ§©

Your app runs... for now. But it's riddled with security vulnerabilities! Can you find and fix them all?

## Game Overview
This puzzle tests your ability to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in a Node.js application. Your mission is to find and fix all security flaws in the code.

## Game Rules

### Objective
Find and fix all security vulnerabilities in the application while maintaining its functionality.

### Scoring
- Each fixed vulnerability is worth points
- Points are awarded based on:
  - Correct identification of the vulnerability
  - Proper implementation of the fix
  - Maintaining application functionality
  - Following security best practices

### Time Limit
- No strict time limit
- Take your time to thoroughly test your fixes
- Quality over speed!

### Allowed Resources
- Official documentation
- Security best practices guides
- Online resources
- Testing tools

### Prohibited Actions
- Removing functionality instead of fixing it
- Using deprecated or insecure solutions
- Skipping proper testing
- Copying solutions from other players

## Vulnerabilities to Find and Fix

### Security Vulnerabilities
1. **Prototype Pollution** (`/prototype-pollution`)
   - Unsafe object merging
   - Allows modification of object prototypes
   - Points: 20

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** (`/xss`)
   - Unsanitized user input
   - Missing input escaping
   - Points: 15

3. **Path Traversal** (`/file`)
   - Unrestricted file access
   - Potential directory traversal attacks
   - Points: 20

4. **Command Injection** (`/ping`)
   - Unsanitized command execution
   - Allows arbitrary command injection
   - Points: 25

5. **Authentication Issues** (`/login`)
   - Weak MD5 password hashing
   - SQL Injection vulnerability
   - String concatenation in queries
   - Points: 30

6. **Broken Access Control** (`/profile`)
   - No authorization checks
   - Horizontal privilege escalation
   - Sensitive data exposure
   - Points: 25

## How to Play

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/merge-quest-org/vulnerability-hunt.git
   cd vulnerability-hunt
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Gameplay
1. **Identify Vulnerabilities**
   - Review the code
   - Test each endpoint
   - Document your findings

2. **Fix Vulnerabilities**
   - Implement secure solutions
   - Follow security best practices

### Submit Your Solution
1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-solution-branch
   ```

2. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix security vulnerabilities"
   ```

3. Open a Pull Request:
   - Push your branch to GitHub
   - Create a Pull Request to the main branch
   - Include a detailed explanation of your fixes (to be determined)

## Testing Your Fixes
- Run the application
- Test each endpoint
- Verify no new vulnerabilities are introduced
- Ensure functionality is maintained

## Tips
- Start with the most critical vulnerabilities
- Test thoroughly after each fix
- Document your changes
- Follow security best practices
- Ask for help if needed

Good luck! May your code be secure and your users be safe! ðŸš€
