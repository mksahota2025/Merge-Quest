# ðŸ§© Merge Quest: Branch Maze

Welcome to **Branch Maze**, your codebase is a disaster of bad branching decisions.

## ðŸ’£ Your Escape Goals:
1. Find and remove unnecessary branches (there are MANY).
2. Identify and resolve merge conflicts.
3. Submit a single clean PR to `main` that:
   - Contains only the correct fix
   - Removes debug/temp files
   - Has no broken branches attached

ðŸ•“ Time Limit: 30 minutes

Good luck â€” the merge gate awaits.
